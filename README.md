# Front-end of a website for an IT team
## Motivation
The reason why I started this project is to explore Web Development and familiarize myself with the basics of Web Technologies. 

## About the project
Using a video-based concept as a blueprint, I implemented the playful design and the functionalities of a website which promotes an IT team and provides the user with the possibility to enroll in it through a form. To build this web interface, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript, setting the fundamentals of Front-end development.

## Description of the website and key features
The website consists of three main sections. The first one includes a description and a pop-up which activates when a button is clicked. While creating the second part, I learned how to integrate videos and images within the design and functionality of the website and I also experimented with different methods for positioning elements on the web page, such as columns, grid and tables. The last section contains a key feature: a form that utilizes multiple types of input.

To further expand my knowledge, I intend to continue this project by improving the form, making the website more interactive (for example, by creating a menu) and making it responsive.
